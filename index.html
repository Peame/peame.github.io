    <h1>Angry Arthur</h1>
    <p>When Arthur's mother won't let him stay up, he becomes <div class="boos">angry</div>, angrier than he's
        ever been. His anger creates a thunderstorm, a hurricane, a universe-quake! But the storm finally calms, and so
        does Arthur, who makes a surprising discovery as he falls asleep.</p>
